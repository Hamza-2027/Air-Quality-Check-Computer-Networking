# Air-Quality-Check-Computer-Networking
The objective for an air quality check in Cisco Packet Tracer can be defined as follows:

Objective: To simulate and monitor air quality parameters in a network environment using Cisco Packet Tracer.

Description:
1. Design a network topology in Cisco Packet Tracer that includes relevant devices, such as sensors, controllers, and monitoring tools.
2. Configure the sensors to collect air quality data, including parameters such as  carbon dioxide levels, and particulate matter.
3. Connect the sensors to the network using appropriate protocols and interfaces.
4. Set up a centralized controller or management system to receive and process the data from the sensors.
5. Implement monitoring tools or software applications that can visualize the air quality data in real-time and provide alerts or notifications for abnormal conditions.
6. Define thresholds or benchmarks for air quality parameters and configure the system to trigger alerts or take automated actions when these thresholds are exceeded.
7. Test the network setup and verify the functionality of the air quality monitoring system.
8. Perform ongoing monitoring and analysis of the air quality data to identify trends, patterns, and potential issues.
9. Use the insights from the air quality monitoring system to take proactive measures for maintaining a healthy and safe environment.
10. Document the setup, configurations, and findings for future reference and improvement.

By achieving this objective, you will have a simulated environment in Cisco Packet Tracer that enables you to monitor and analyze air quality parameters, facilitating proactive measures for maintaining a healthy and safe environment in real-world scenarios.
